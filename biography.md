I'm doing my PhD in urban and regional science at [College of Architecture, Texas A&M University](https://www.arch.tamu.edu/), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Boqian Xu](https://www.arch.tamu.edu/staff/boqian-xu/). As for my master degree, I was supervised by [Prof. Zhigang Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cjNKF9oAAAAJ&hl) in the [School of Urban Design](https://sud.whu.edu.cn/) at the [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). I also obtained my BS in urban and rural planning from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/).
