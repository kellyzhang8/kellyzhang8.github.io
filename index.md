I am an Ph.D. student in the [College of Architecture](https://www.arch.tamu.edu/) at the [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/).

My research lies at the intersection of **residents** and **environmental justice** -- with a special focus on climate justice and Ecological Footprint analysis to support data-driven planning strategies for vulnerable communities. My research interests include **urban studies**, **spatial analysis**, **machine learning**, **Job-housing balance**.

Previously, I completed my PhD in Computer Science at [Max Planck Institute for Informatics](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/) and my BS in Electronic Information Engineering at [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm). I also spent time at [Johns Hopkins](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/), [Oxford VGG](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/), and [National University of Singapore](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/). My biography is [here](./biography/).
