<h1 id="about-me"></h1>

<h2 style="margin: 80px 0px 10px;"></h2>

I am an Ph.D. student in the [College of Architecture](https://www.arch.tamu.edu/) at the [Texas A&M University](https://www.tamu.edu/).

My research lies at the intersection of **residents** and **environmental justice** -- with a special focus on climate justice and Ecological Footprint analysis to support data-driven planning strategies for vulnerable communities. My research interests include **urban studies**, **spatial analysis**, **machine learning**, **Job-housing balance**.


<strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600"><strong style="color:#e74d3c; font-weight:600">I am actively seeking collaboration opportunities with those interested in climate justice. If you are interested, please send me an email. You may see details [here](./openings/).</strong>
